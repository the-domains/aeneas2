Britain Asks if Tone of 'Brexit' Campaign Made Violence Inevitable

LONDON --- As the shock of the [brutal murder ][0] of a young member of Parliament began to subside on Friday, there was a growing sense in [Britain][1] that something ominous had been unleashed in the country.

The increasingly ugly anti-immigrant tone to the campaign over [next week's referendum][2] on Britain's membership in the [European Union][3], coupled with the [violence of English fans][4] at the European soccer championships and now the killing of a lawmaker on the streets of a small town, has left many here feeling that the boundaries of acceptable behavior are breaking down.

"What we are just seeing generally is a very disturbing shift in British politics," said Simon Tilford, the deputy director of the Center for European Reform, which favors British membership. "It is quite upsetting to me what is happening."

With next Thursday's vote on the referendum only days away, campaigning was suspended as a gesture of mourning and respect for the victim, Jo Cox, 41, a rising star in the opposition Labour Party who, not coincidentally, was a strong backer of Britain's remaining inside the bloc.

While it is still too early to say how the attack will change the dynamics of the campaign, it has unquestionably shifted the focus from the growing momentum of those in favor of leaving to the anti-immigrant tactics they have employed as the vote has drawn closer.
